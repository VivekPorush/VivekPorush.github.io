[Audio Amplifier](https://github.com/VivekPorush/VivekPorush.github.io/tree/gh-pages/Audio%20Amplifier): A 4 watt dual channel Audio Amplifier with led display for volume control. \r\n2. [LPF using MOS Active Resistor](https://github.com/VivekPorush/VivekPorush.github.io/tree/gh-pages/LPF%20using%20MOS%20Active%20Resistor): Passive resistors are not preferred for ON CHIP fabrication, due to their large area. This project implement Active Resistor using MOS technology. These resistors can be economically fabricated on IC's.\r\n3. [Comparator](https://github.com/VivekPorush/VivekPorush.github.io/tree/gh-pages/Comparator): Basic Comparator circuit using LM 741 comparator.\r\n4. [LPF & HPF First Order](https://github.com/VivekPorush/VivekPorush.github.io/tree/gh-pages/Low%20Pass%20Filter%20%26%20High%20Pass%20Filter): First order filters using LM 741 Op-Amp.\r\n\r\n### Digital Resources\r\nSoon!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Computer Architecture Resources\r\nSoon!!!\r\n\r\n### Publications And Research Work\r\n1.
